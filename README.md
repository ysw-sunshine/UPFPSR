# UPFPSR
A Ubiquitylation Predictor for Plant through Combining Sequence Information and Random Forest

## Overview
In this study, we propose a novel predictor, named UPFPSR, for predicting lysine ubiquitylation sites of plant. UPFPSR is developed using multiple physicochemical properties of amino acids and sequence-based statistical information. In order to find a suitable classification algorithm, four traditional algorithms and two deep learning networks are compared, and the random forest with superior performance is selected ultimately. 

## Requirements
* Python>=3.6
* Matlab2018a

## Introduction
The code is the implementation of UPFPSR method “A Ubiquitylation Predictor for Plant 
through Combining Sequence Information and Random Forest”
