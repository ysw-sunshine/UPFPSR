## Introduction
The code is the implementation of UPFPSR method “A Ubiquitylation Predictor for Plant 
through Combining Sequence Information and Random Forest”  

  1. The dataset file contains the plant ubiquitination protein sequences, the training dataset,
     the indepedent data set and the code of data processing.
  2. The feature extraction file contains the code of DBPB,EGAAC,PseAAC and PWAA.
  3. The classifier file contains the code of UPFPSR method used in our study.
